NAME
       pcre-config - program to return PCRE configuration

SYNOPSIS

       pcre-config [--prefix] [--exec-prefix] [--version] [--libs]
            [--libs-posix] [--cflags] [--cflags-posix]


DESCRIPTION

       pcre-config  returns  the configuration of the installed PCRE libraries
       and the options required to compile a program to use them.


OPTIONS

       --prefix  Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for
                 architecture   independent   files  (/usr  on  many  systems,
                 /usr/local on some systems) to the standard output.

       --exec-prefix
                 Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for
                 architecture  dependent files (normally the same as --prefix)
                 to the standard output.

       --version Writes the version number of the installed PCRE libraries  to
                 the standard output.

       --libs    Writes  to  the  standard  output  the  command  line options
                 required to link with PCRE (-lpcre on many systems).

       --libs-posix
                 Writes to  the  standard  output  the  command  line  options
                 required  to  link  with  the  PCRE  posix  emulation library
                 (-lpcreposix -lpcre on many systems).

       --cflags  Writes to  the  standard  output  the  command  line  options
                 required  to  compile  files  that use PCRE (this may include
                 some -I options, but is blank on many systems).

       --cflags-posix
                 Writes to  the  standard  output  the  command  line  options
                 required  to  compile files that use the PCRE posix emulation
                 library (this may include some -I options, but  is  blank  on
                 many systems).
