//
//  The CallStack Class
//
//    CallStack objects can be used for obtaining, storing, and displaying the
//    call stack at a given point during program execution.
//
//    The primary data structure used by the CallStack is similar in concept to
//    a STL vector, but is specifically tailored for use by VLD, making it more
//    efficient than a standard STL vector.
//
//    Inside the CallStack are a number of "chunks" which are arranged in a
//    linked list. Each chunk contains an array of frames (each frame is
//    represented by a program counter address). If we run out of space when
//    pushing new frames onto an existing chunk in the CallStack chunk list,
//    then a new chunk is allocated and appended to the end of the list. In this
//    way, the CallStack can grow dynamically as needed. New frames are always
//    pushed onto the chunk at the end of the list known as the "top" chunk.
//
//    IMPORTANT NOTE: This class as originally written makes two fatal assumptions: 
//    First: That the application will never load modules (call LoadLibrary) during the 
//           lifetime of the app.
//    Second: That modules will never get unloaded (call to FreeLibrary)
//            during the lifetime of the app.
//    The result of this assumption is that
//    memory allocations whose call stacks goes through dynamically loaded modules
//    will be incomplete. This is manifested by stack frames that cannot be resolved
//    when the stack is 'dumped' because the binaries have been unloaded from the
//    process. 
//    To rectify this situation, it is up to the caller to resolve or format the call stacks
//    into human readable form, BEFORE the callers process unloads any modules. That is
//    done by calling VisualLeakDetector::ResolveCallstacks, which can be called from 
//    external code by the exported VLDResolveCallstacks function.
//    When this happens, the call stacks are formatted, and then cached for later dumping.
//    This has performance penalties, as the current implementation saves all info to heap memory,
//    and it is wasteful, as some of the 'converted' memory is not a true leak, but will get
//    properly de-allocated at a later time. However there is no other way to work around the
//    fact that the call stacks can only get formatted when the binary is loaded in the process.
