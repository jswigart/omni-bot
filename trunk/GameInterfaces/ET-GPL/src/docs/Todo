claimed	must do
=======	=======
	xxx - gameinfo.dat for etmain is borked
	xxx - bounds checking run
	xxx - Command map has some really bizarre problem related to classes
		(when players are in PVS, iirc.)  I need to look at this
		and add details to this todo item.
	xxx - vc project files use multithread flags (/MT,/MTd)
		they should use singlecaded flags (/ML,/MLd) instead
		is this due to curl? if so, curl needs to be singlethreaded too.

		Some people have been complaining about that"
fretn	xxx - allow alternate messages to "server is full" (cvar perhaps?) -> sv_fullmsg		
bani	245 - revive usually snaps your view
bani	xxx - Arnout: "One thing we wanted to do is delay snapshot sending
		while a client is connecting. There is no need to send full
		snapshots while the client is loading a map, only thing you
		have to do is a 'keep alive'. (This is what Doom is doing as
		well) Gordon did a quick implementation of that last year, but
		couldn't get it working properly (didn't have enough time to
		play around with it). This would fix all those time out problems
		for mods with longer level load times."

fretn	xxx - ugh. linux uses sndbits/sndspeed/sndchannels.
		win32 uses s_khz and is fixed to 16bit stereo.
		unify?
fretn	xxx - switch to GT_WOLF if map can't start a campaign?
fretn	xxx - remove CL_buyNow_f / CL_singlePlayLink_f ?

bani	xxx - fix the profile.pid madness

	optional
	========
	xxx - zinx optimized huffman
	xxx - optimized strncpy
	xxx - misc renderer bugs
		<ikkyo> something in the et engine is causing shaders with a single stage to ignore fadeStartTime and fadeEndTime
		<ikkyo> cause I noticed the thrown away panzerfaust still faded out, but it has a two stage shader
		<ikkyo> it doesn't fade out correctly though, it kinda changes brightness before it starts to fade. the way I did the gib shader avoids that
	338 - server-side changes of team, class, and weapon update limbo menu
		fixes losing weapon on mapchanges, random weapon lossage on skill upgrades, etc.
	xxx - UI is uselessly reloaded on /quit, which is slow in etmain
	xxx - Way to remove flags from a cvar and/or remove cvars
	xxx - pmove_fixed fixes (actual code changes pretty trivial)
	xxx - ignore ridiculous mouse deltas when re-grabbing like D3 does?
	xxx - r_fullscreen sometimes gets confused, ET can permanently lose
		focus (linux)
	xxx - In serverInfo_t (which is used for the server browser), the
		server hostname (i.e. sv_hostname) is only
		MAX_NAME_LENGTH (32) chars wide, which is quite a bit
		smaller than the server browser displays (especially with
		colors in the hostname.)  If we change it, though, we need
		a way to invalidate the old servercache.dat, because it
		won't be compatible anymore.
	633 - s_doppler is buggy (can't reproduce this -.-)
	xxx - fix sound clipping bug (e.g. tank turret)
	xxx - remove extraneous etconfig.cfg outside of profiles/?
	xxx - no way to remove temporary bans added with kick/clientkick
	      (may want to move the kick code into qagame if it's easy to do)
	xxx - fonts loaded with trap_R_RegisterFont have a broken shader in
	      the glyphInfo for glyph 0xff
	xxx - special trace to ignore transparent clipbrushes?
		(eg the huge invisible brushes around the tree trunks on oasis)
	xxx - Re-add gibs
	xxx - Sprint bar doesn't work when spectating or viewing a demo.
	xxx - Mortar/deployed MG42 angles are screwy when spectating or
		viewing a demo.
	xxx - properly pass parameters to pmove instead of kludging it with
		externs.  current way is wrong and sets a bad example
		for modders.
	xxx - fix 8-bit wrapping in weapon heat (see etpro_bg_pmove.c:3321 et al.)
	xxx - vid_restart often corrupts textures
	xxx - make MAX_STREAMING_SOUNDS a cvar?
	xxx - occlusion queries to optimize rendering?
		see R_AddEntitySurfaces()
