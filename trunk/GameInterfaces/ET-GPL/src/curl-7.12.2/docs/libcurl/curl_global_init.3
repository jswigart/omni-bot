.SH NAME
curl_global_init - Global libcurl initialisation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_global_init(long " flags ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function should only be called once (no matter how many threads or
libcurl sessions that'll be used) by every application that uses libcurl.

If this function hasn't been invoked when \fIcurl_easy_init(3)\fP is called,
it will be done automatically by libcurl.

The flags option is a bit pattern that tells libcurl exact what features to
init, as described below. Set the desired bits by ORing the values together.

You must however \fBalways\fP use the \fIcurl_global_cleanup(3)\fP function,
as that cannot be called automatically for you by libcurl.

Calling this function more than once will cause unpredictable results.

.SH FLAGS
.TP 5
.B CURL_GLOBAL_ALL
Initialize everything possible. This sets all known bits.

.B CURL_GLOBAL_SSL
Initialize SSL
.TP
.B CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32
Initialize the Win32 socket libraries.
.TP
.B CURL_GLOBAL_NOTHING
Initialise nothing extra. This sets no bit.
.SH RETURN VALUE

other curl functions.
