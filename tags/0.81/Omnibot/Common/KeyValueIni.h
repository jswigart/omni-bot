/*!
 * \brief
 * Write loadKeyValueIni loads an INI file by filename and returns an opaque handle to the interface.  If null, then the file was not found or was empty.
 *
 * \param fname
 * The name of the file on disk to load.
 *
 * \param sections
 * A reference to an unsigned integer that will report the number of init sections in the file.  A special init section called '@HEADER' contains values that were found before any section block.
 *
 * \returns
 * Returns an opaque pointer to the KeyValueIni interface.
 *
 * Write detailed description for loadKeyValueIni here.
 *
 * Loads .INI files that can be separated into sections using the bracket keys.  Example [RENDER] [PHYSICS] etc.  Supports key value pairs in the form
 * of KEY=VALUE or it will support a single KEY entry with no accompanying value.  Keys encountered prior to encountering any section are placed in the
 * default section of '@HEADER'
 *
 * Note that if you have a section called [RENDER] and then a section called [MESH] but later refer to [RENDER] again, this does *not* create a new section, it
 * adds the keys to the previously defined section.
 *
 * Note also that all returned pointers are persistent up until the KeyValueIni file is released.  That means you can avoid string copies and instead only cache the
 * pointers internally so long as you keep the INI file loaded.
