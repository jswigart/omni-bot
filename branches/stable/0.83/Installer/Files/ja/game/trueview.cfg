//True View Auto Eye Adjust Config File
//
//Purpose:  Some of the less human looking models have faces
//	    that totally clips thru the camera.  This file
//	    sets the eye position (forward/backward) on model
//	    loading.  The Default is 0.0.  This is based on the 
//	    name, not the skinname.
//
//Notes:    The parse reader for this file is picky.  
//          Be sure to keep the format the same.
//
//	    This must be in the mod's base directory for this to 
//	    work.
//
//	    Please send in valid settings to the OJP Team so they
//	    can be added in latter versions.
//   
//   	    It is recommended that only non-zero setting models are 
//          put in this file.
